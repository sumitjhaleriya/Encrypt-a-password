# Encrypt-a-password
This Python project showcases the creation of a secure password encrypter using the `cryptography` library. By leveraging modern encryption techniques, you can safeguard sensitive information and enhance the security of your applications.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the process of encrypting and decrypting passwords using the `cryptography` library's `Fernet` encryption scheme. `Fernet` uses symmetric encryption, allowing you to securely protect and retrieve sensitive data.

## Key Features

- Encryption and decryption using modern cryptography.
- Easy-to-understand code structure with clear functions for key generation, encryption, and decryption.
- Built-in key management by the `cryptography` library, simplifying secure key handling.
- Illustrates the importance of secure practices in data handling and encryption.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11
- `cryptography` library

To install the required library, use the following command:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```

## Security
Security is paramount in today's digital world. This project emphasizes the significance of encryption, secure data handling, and responsible application design. By understanding and implementing encryption techniques like the ones demonstrated here, you contribute to a safer digital landscape.
